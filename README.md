# Bank-Classification

In the Bank Marketing Dataset, we want to predict if a client will put a term deposit. 

To start off, I did an **Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)** and **Data Visualizations** to understand the data set variables & the relationship among them.
After doing the Data Analysis & Visualizations, we do Data Cleaning & Data Pre-processing to fit into our models.

Here we will be performing a Classification Model. We will compare the **8 Models** and see how they perform.
 ### 8 Models
 
 1. **GradientBoostingClassifier** Accuracy % -> **90.98**
 2. **XGBClassifier** Accuracy %              -> **90.91**
 3. **Random Forest** Accuracy %              -> **90.544**
 4. **Logistic Regression** Accuracy %        -> **90.4**
 5. **Support Vector Machine** Accuracy %     -> **90.29**
 6. **K-Nearest-Neighbors** Accuracy %        -> **90.09**
 7. **Decision Tree** Accuracy %              -> **88.21**
 8. **Gaussian Naive Bayes** Accuracy %       -> **84.69**

We can see that the **GradientBoostingClassifier** Model performed the **BEST** at **90.98 %** Accuracy.

We can see that the **Gaussian Naive Bayes** Model performed the **WORST** at **84.69 %** Accuracy.
